Known to concentrate along thermal discontinuities (Ref. 168).  Form mixed schools with skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>), yellowfin tuna (<i>Thunnus albacares</i>) and bluefin tuna (<i>T. maccoyii</i>), schools may be associated with floating objects, including sargassum weeds (Ref. 168).  Feed on fishes, crustaceans and squids.  Eggs and larvae are pelagic (Ref. 6769).  Sexual maturity reached at 90 cm (Ref. 36731).  Highly appreciated and marketed fresh, smoked, deep frozen or canned.  Eaten steamed, broiled, fried and microwaved (Ref. 9987).  Also Ref. 1762, 1798, 1804.\r\nAngling: Largely caught offshore, where the waters are mild and blue.  Albacore favor those areas where cooler water interfaces with warmer water.  They are caught with live of dead baitfish such as mullet, sauries, squid, herring, anchovies, sardines, and other small fish.  Albacore strike hard and make powerful runs (Ref. 84357).", "PriceCateg": "high", "Pic": "THALA_U0", "UsedasBait": "never/rarely", "Entered": 2, "Species": "alalunga", "Landings": "By Japan(61), Spain(27), Korea Rep.(77)", "CommonLengthF": null, "LongevityCapRef": null, "DepthRangeDeep": 600, "Source": "R", "Brack": 0, "GameFish": -1, "PicPreferredName": "Thala_u4.jpg", "Electrogenic": "no special ability", "MSeines": 0, "CommonLength": 100.0, "MSpears": 0, "SpecCode": 142, "TaxIssue": 0, "PriceReliability": "Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species", "BaitRef": null, "ImportanceRef": 4931, "Remarks7": "Bycatch of swordfish fishery.", "Modified": 2, "MTrawls": 0, "DangerousRef": null, "MCastnets": 0, "EggPic": null, "II": "purse seines (PS)", "Weight": 60320.0, "SpeciesRefNo": 168, "LongevityCaptive": null, "DateEntered": "1990-10-17T00:00:00.000Z", "MainCatchingMethod": "seines", "DepthRangeShallow": 0, "GenCode": 8961, "AquacultureRef": null, "Genus": "Thunnus", "DepthRangeComShallow": null, "AquariumRef": null, "MGillnets": 0, "Emblematic": 0, "Subfamily": "Scombrinae", "UsedforAquaculture": "never/rarely", "CommonLengthRef": 9684, "Dangerous": "harmless", "DateChecked": "1999-08-19T00:00:00.000Z", "DateModified": "2016-07-13T00:00:00.000Z", "Saltwater": -1, "MOther": -1, "MaxLengthRef": 3669, "DepthComRef": null, "DepthRangeRef": 168, "MLiftnets": 0, "DemersPelag": "pelagic-oceanic", "MHooksLines": -1, "PicPreferredNameM": null, "PD50": 0.5039, "LandingStatistics": "from 100,000 to 500,000", "GoogleImage": -1, "WeightFemale": null, "Profile": null, "AnaCat": "oceanodromous", "Complete": null, "AuthorRef": null, "FamCode": 416, "ElectroRef": null, "LengthFemale": null, "Vulnerability": 58.4, "LongevityWildRef": 72462, "MDredges": 0, "LTypeMaxF": null, "LongevityWild": 9.0, "Fresh": 0, "AquariumFishII": " ", "LifeCycle": " ", "LTypeMaxM": "FL", "MigratRef": 51243, "Length": 140.0, "DepthRangeComDeep": null, "FBname": "Albacore"}], "returned": 1, "error": null}
