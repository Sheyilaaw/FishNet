Fry may migrate to the sea after only 3 months in fresh water, some may stay for as long as 3 years, but generally most stay a year in the stream before migrating (Ref. 27547).  Some individuals remain close inshore throughout their lives, but some make extensive migrations (Ref. 27547, 44894).  Also found in lakes (Ref. 1998).  Possibly up to 375 m depth (Ref. 6793).  Epipelagic (Ref. 58426).  Food in streams is mainly terrestrial insects and small crustaceans; in the sea, major food items include fishes, crustaceans, and other invertebrates (Ref. 27547).  Young are preyed upon by fishes and birds (such as mergansers and kingfishers); adults are prey of large mammals and large birds (Ref. 1998).  Highly regarded game fish (Ref. 27547).  Flesh is usually red, but some are white; the red meat commands a higher price (Ref. 27547).  Marketed fresh, smoked, frozen, and canned.  Eaten steamed, fried, broiled, boiled, microwaved, and baked (Ref. 9988).  Viscera said to contain high vitamin A content and used successfully as food for hatchery fish (Ref. 28971, 28977).", "PriceCateg": "very high", "Pic": "ONTSH_U1", "UsedasBait": "never/rarely", "Entered": 2, "Species": "tshawytscha", "Landings": "Canada (Ref. 9988)", "CommonLengthF": null, "LongevityCapRef": 273, "DepthRangeDeep": 375, "Source": "O", "Brack": -1, "GameFish": -1, "PicPreferredName": "Ontsh_m1.jpg", "Electrogenic": "no special ability", "MSeines": -1, "CommonLength": 70.0, "MSpears": 0, "SpecCode": 244, "TaxIssue": 0, "PriceReliability": "Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species", "BaitRef": null, "ImportanceRef": 4931, "Remarks7": null, "Modified": 2, "MTrawls": -1, "DangerousRef": 12257, "MCastnets": 0, "EggPic": null, "II": null, "Weight": 61400.0, "SpeciesRefNo": 5723, "LongevityCaptive": 4.0, "DateEntered": "1990-10-17T00:00:00.000Z", "MainCatchingMethod": null, "DepthRangeShallow": 0, "GenCode": 2445, "AquacultureRef": 12108, "Genus": "Oncorhynchus", "DepthRangeComShallow": null, "AquariumRef": 9183, "MGillnets": -1, "Emblematic": 0, "Subfamily": "Salmoninae", "UsedforAquaculture": "commercial", "CommonLengthRef": 9258, "Dangerous": "potential pest", "DateChecked": "2003-01-09T00:00:00.000Z", "DateModified": "2016-07-13T00:00:00.000Z", "Saltwater": -1, "MOther": -1, "MaxLengthRef": 40637, "DepthComRef": null, "DepthRangeRef": 58426, "MLiftnets": 0, "DemersPelag": "benthopelagic", "MHooksLines": -1, "PicPreferredNameM": null, "PD50": 0.5, "LandingStatistics": "from 10,000 to 50,000", "GoogleImage": -1, "WeightFemale": null, "Profile": null, "AnaCat": "anadromous", "Complete": null, "AuthorRef": null, "FamCode": 76, "ElectroRef": null, "LengthFemale": null, "Vulnerability": 68.24, "LongevityWildRef": 12193, "MDredges": -1, "LTypeMaxF": null, "LongevityWild": 9.0, "Fresh": -1, "AquariumFishII": "based mainly on capture", "LifeCycle": null, "LTypeMaxM": "TL", "MigratRef": 51243, "Length": 150.0, "DepthRangeComDeep": null, "FBname": "Chinook salmon"}], "returned": 1, "error": null}
