Juveniles prefer shallow (less than 10-30 m depth) sublittoral waters with complex habitats, such as seagrass beds, areas with gravel, rocks, or boulder, which provide protection from predators (Refs. 89383, 89384). Adults are usually found in deeper, colder waters. During the day, form schools and swim about 30-80 m above the bottom, dispersing at night to feed (Ref. 1371, 89385). Omnivorous; feed at dawn or dusk on invertebrates and fish, including young cod. (Ref. 1371). Migrate between spawning, feeding and overwintering areas, mostly within the boundaries of the respective stocks. Migrations >200 km are rare occurrences (Refs. 89386, 89387). Marketed fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; eaten steamed, fried, broiled, boiled, microwaved and baked (Ref. 9988).", "PriceCateg": "medium", "Pic": "GAMOR_U4", "UsedasBait": "never/rarely", "Entered": 2, "Species": "morhua", "Landings": "Canada, Iceland, Europe, Norway and Russia", "CommonLengthF": null, "LongevityCapRef": null, "DepthRangeDeep": 600, "Source": "R", "Brack": -1, "GameFish": -1, "PicPreferredName": "Gamor_u3.jpg", "Electrogenic": "no special ability", "MSeines": -1, "CommonLength": 100.0, "MSpears": 0, "SpecCode": 69, "TaxIssue": 0, "PriceReliability": "Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species", "BaitRef": null, "ImportanceRef": 4931, "Remarks7": null, "Modified": 10, "MTrawls": -1, "DangerousRef": null, "MCastnets": 0, "EggPic": null, "II": "bottom otter trawls (OTB)", "Weight": 96000.0, "SpeciesRefNo": 1371, "LongevityCaptive": null, "DateEntered": "1990-10-17T00:00:00.000Z", "MainCatchingMethod": "trawls", "DepthRangeShallow": 0, "GenCode": 3348, "AquacultureRef": 12108, "Genus": "Gadus", "DepthRangeComShallow": 150, "AquariumRef": 12253, "MGillnets": -1, "Emblematic": 0, "Subfamily": null, "UsedforAquaculture": "commercial", "CommonLengthRef": 1371, "Dangerous": "harmless", "DateChecked": "2000-11-22T16:48:22.000Z", "DateModified": "2014-07-10T00:00:00.000Z", "Saltwater": -1, "MOther": -1, "MaxLengthRef": 1371, "DepthComRef": 54441, "DepthRangeRef": 1371, "MLiftnets": 0, "DemersPelag": "benthopelagic", "MHooksLines": -1, "PicPreferredNameM": null, "PD50": 0.625, "LandingStatistics": "more than 500,000", "GoogleImage": -1, "WeightFemale": null, "Profile": null, "AnaCat": "oceanodromous", "Complete": null, "AuthorRef": null, "FamCode": 183, "ElectroRef": null, "LengthFemale": null, "Vulnerability": 65.4, "LongevityWildRef": 173, "MDredges": 0, "LTypeMaxF": null, "LongevityWild": 25.0, "Fresh": 0, "AquariumFishII": "based mainly on capture", "LifeCycle": " ", "LTypeMaxM": "TL", "MigratRef": 51243, "Length": 200.0, "DepthRangeComDeep": 200, "FBname": "Atlantic cod"}], "returned": 1, "error": null}
