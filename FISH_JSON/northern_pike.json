Usually solitary and highly territorial.  Enters brackish water in the Baltic.  Adults feed mainly on fishes, but at times feed heavily on frogs and crayfish (Ref. 27547).  Cannibalism is common.  In arctic lakes, it is sometimes the only species present in a given water body.  In such cases, juveniles feed on invertebrates and terrestrial vertebrates; large individuals are mainly cannibals (Ref. 59043). Cannibalistic as juveniles (Ref. 30578).  Feces of pike are avoided by other fish because they contain alarm pheromones.  Deposits feces at specific locations, distant from its foraging area (Ref. 59043).  Eggs and young are preyed upon by fishes, aquatic insect larvae, birds, and aquatic mammals (Ref. 1998).  Does not generally undertake long migrations, but a few may move considerable distances (Ref. 27547).  Oviparous (Ref. 205). This fish can be heavily infested with parasites, including the broad tapeworm which, if not killed by thorough cooking, can infect human; is used as an intermediate host by a cestode parasite which results to large losses in usable catches of lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>) in some areas; also suffers from a trematode which causes unsightly cysts on the skin (Ref. 9988).  Excellent food fish; utilized fresh and frozen; eaten pan-fried, broiled, and baked (Ref. 9988).  Valuable game fish (Ref. 5723).  In spite of numerous attempts to culture this species, it was never entirely domesticated and does not accept artificial food (Ref. 30578).  Locally impacted by habitat alterations (Ref. 59043).", "PriceCateg": "unknown", "Pic": "ESLUC_U5", "UsedasBait": "never/rarely", "Entered": 2, "Species": "lucius", "Landings": null, "CommonLengthF": 55.0, "LongevityCapRef": 72462, "DepthRangeDeep": 30, "Source": "O", "Brack": -1, "GameFish": -1, "PicPreferredName": "Esluc_u9.jpg", "Electrogenic": "no special ability", "MSeines": 0, "CommonLength": 40.0, "MSpears": 0, "SpecCode": 258, "TaxIssue": 0, "PriceReliability": null, "BaitRef": null, "ImportanceRef": 4931, "Remarks7": null, "Modified": 10, "MTrawls": -1, "DangerousRef": null, "MCastnets": 0, "EggPic": null, "II": null, "Weight": 28350.0, "SpeciesRefNo": 26373, "LongevityCaptive": 10.0, "DateEntered": "1990-10-17T00:00:00.000Z", "MainCatchingMethod": "seines", "DepthRangeShallow": 0, "GenCode": 3435, "AquacultureRef": 26920, "Genus": "Esox", "DepthRangeComShallow": 1, "AquariumRef": 12253, "MGillnets": 0, "Emblematic": 0, "Subfamily": null, "UsedforAquaculture": "commercial", "CommonLengthRef": 556, "Dangerous": "potential pest", "DateChecked": "2003-01-14T00:00:00.000Z", "DateModified": "2012-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "Saltwater": 0, "MOther": -1, "MaxLengthRef": 40637, "DepthComRef": 1998, "DepthRangeRef": 1998, "MLiftnets": 0, "DemersPelag": "demersal", "MHooksLines": -1, "PicPreferredNameM": null, "PD50": 0.5157, "LandingStatistics": "from 10,000 to 50,000", "GoogleImage": -1, "WeightFemale": 35000.0, "Profile": null, "AnaCat": "potamodromous", "Complete": null, "AuthorRef": null, "FamCode": 74, "ElectroRef": null, "LengthFemale": 150.0, "Vulnerability": 85.4, "LongevityWildRef": 556, "MDredges": 0, "LTypeMaxF": "TL", "LongevityWild": 30.0, "Fresh": -1, "AquariumFishII": "based mainly on capture", "LifeCycle": null, "LTypeMaxM": "FL", "MigratRef": null, "Length": 137.0, "DepthRangeComDeep": 5, "FBname": "Northern pike"}], "returned": 1, "error": null}
